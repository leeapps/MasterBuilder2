Rubrik Master Builder Part 2

Requirements
1. You must create a Report in your Rubrik cluster called "Rubrik Protection Summary" with the Object Protection Summary template.
2. The report must have all items selected for the table in the template.
3. Power BI must be installed for reporting (available from the windows store) or https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/


Usage
1. Once your report is created run the script, the script saves a csv file to your local c:\temp directory
2. Open the power BI report and refresh the data

Notes:
You don't need to run the script if you don't want to, just create a Object Protection Summary report with all items in the table selected and save the file to your "c:\temp" named x So that PowerBI can read the Data.
